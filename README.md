## Intro
When I was thinking about the 2nd Milestone my eye fell on a Youtube to make cubes and balls in a 3D environment, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdftnCDwKaU.
The youtube showed up on May 11th 2021, that timing was great for me, because before that there is nothing really good to be found on Youtube about CSS 3D. So without that there was no other options then to make a boring 2D game. (smiley)
I did some experiments myself to create cubes and balls based on that 3D idea. In that Youtube, there was only a shadow effect on the ball, but after some expriments I added a light reflection effect in the balls. 

First I thougt to make the game "Mastermind". But it turned out that when you make rows in 3D, you get a problem. The first rows are easy to see but when you get to row 8 for example, there is a horizon effect so these rows are difficult to distinguish from each other. That should not have been a nice game experience. The solution should be to make Mastermind in 2D, but my goal is to make something in 3D, just because I like it.

After that my idea went to make a "Four in a Row" game. A game I played a lot, just on paper, in my high school times a long time ago. It was very important for me to prove it was do-able in the amount of time given voor the 2nd Milestone. Therefore I made an experimental "4 in a Row"-ish 3D structure, the cordinates and size of cubes and balls had te be find out by just trying. That expirement can be found here: https://3d-14.dikkeschei.repl.co/. 
That was a lot of copy-pasting of cubes classes en ball classes with a slightly different coordinate because it's a CSS only structure.
It turned out to be a succesfully created structure, now I definitely decided to make a 3D game "4 in a Row" based on Javascript.

The idea is to copy cubes fith a for loop

To do:
* fix the color of mousecursor because it is the opposite of what color it must have.
* Make a falling ball-animation when a move take place
* make a finishing text when last move is made, proclaim te winner.
* make the intro page also in smartphone mode.
* fix the resolution problem of extra long smartphones.
* Bring in AI.
* when there is time: make an intro annimation of zooming in and a turn of 360 degrees at the same time when te game starts
